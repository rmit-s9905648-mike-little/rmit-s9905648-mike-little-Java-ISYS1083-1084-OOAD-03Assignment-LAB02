## Assignment Activities [MANDATORY]



#### Task 2: src/main/java/task2 [10 marks]

In this section “design pattern” refers to the catalogue of patterns by Gamma et al. that were presented in this course and the immutable data structure patterns.

For each of the three scenarios below state which design pattern can best solve the problem and explain (in the space provided) how the design pattern is applied to the specific case. Provide a class diagram for each scenario as well.

QUEST04. A GUI-driven application is planned with a standard model view controller (MVC) design which has many views, many controllers and a single model. The model functionality is complex and so is the GUI thus a single user action (such as a menu selection or a button press) will require the participation of many view and controller objects working together to be synchronised. Please use at least two views (i.e., CardView and LayoutView) and two controllers (i.e., CardController and LayoutController) in the diagram.

Refer to "ANSWERS-TASK1-QUEST04.md"

QUEST05. A cross-platform GUI toolkit has many widgets and components and is designed to run on multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. New platforms should also be supported with minimal changes to client code.

Refer to "ANSWERS-TASK1-QUEST05.md"

QUEST06. A diagramming application provides multi-level undo based on a history of operations that have been performed on the diagram.
