**SCENARIO:**

>The company is in need of developing an application to manage their employee’s data and print their payslips. Assuming that their employees are of 5 types:
>
> - Salaried employees who are paid a fixed monthly salary regardless of the number of hours worked and paid leave hours.
> - Contract employees who are paid a fixed monthly salary regardless of the number of hours worked.
> - Casual employees who are paid by the hour and receive overtime pay (i.e., double hourly salary rate) for all hours worked inexcess of 38 hours.
> - Commission employees who are paid a base salary plus a commission of 25% of their sales.
> - Commission interns who are paid a commission of 15% of their sales.
>
> The company wants to write an application that performs its payroll calculations and has other database management functions like retrieval of records, adding and deleting of records, etc. The company wants you to write an application that performs the following functions.
> - The admin can log in and log out to the system.
> - After login, the system should provide options like adding new employee records, changing employee’s details, navigating through employee’s details and making a search for an employee’s details.

**ACTIVITIES**

QUEST01. Based on the requirements in the above case study, you need to design and build the class diagram with the attributes and operations of each class. You must include the relationships that are needed. Save it as a `png` file in the corresponding folder.

Refer to "ANSWERS-TASK1-QUEST01.md"

QUEST02. Use the `ANSWER.md` file to explain _which_ behavioural and architectural patterns you selected, and _which_. You need to justify your decision, so be as extensive as needed. You are _not_ allowed to copy-paste definitions, you need to explain everything in the context of the example.
    * If you used creational patterns, you can simply name those without any further explanation needed (only in the case of creational patterns).

Refer to "ANSWERS-TASK1-QUEST02.md"


QUEST03. Implement the code for the diagram above. The code inside the methods can be a dummy return, or have a `//TODO` comment that explains the logic that should be implemented.
