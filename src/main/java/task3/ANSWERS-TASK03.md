## Introduction
This assessment evaluates the following CLOs

- CLO2: Identify and mitigate the risks associated with the development of large-scale software projects.
- CLO3: Apply the UML design notation as part of the OO development process.
- CLO4: Explain and document diagrammatically specific Design Patterns from established pattern catalogues and apply them to novel design problems.


The following topics are assessed:

- Week 6: Creational Patterns.
- Week 7-8: Structural Patterns.
- Week 9-10: Behavioural Patterns.
- Week 11: Architectural Patterns




## Assignment Activities [MANDATORY]



#### Task 3: src/main/java/task3 [10 marks]

**SCENARIO**

> Melbourne Travel, which hires flights from different airlines, wants to offer customised on-board meals based on travel distance. There are two categories of flights: short trip and long distance. The short trip meal consists of a snack and a soft drink, while a full meal for a long-distance flight comprises an appetizer, main, salad, dessert and drink. While the customer can choose different items in each category (main, dessert, snack, etc.) they must choose from the specific items served by each of the hired airlines. For example, the dessert category for Virgin Airlines might include ice cream and jelly, whereas the main category for Singapore Airlines might include chicken, beef, fish and a vegetarian option.
>
> You are required to develop a design that simplifies the following extensions:
>
> (1) new types of meals (i.e., appetizer, main, dessert and drink for a medium-distance flight);
> (2) new airlines which provide different meal options in each category.


QUEST07. Draw a class diagram for your proposed solution incorporating at least two design patterns using the naming of the problem domain, i.e., do not just draw generic pattern diagrams that do not apply to the airline meal scenario. Your class diagram should include both of the concrete meal types described above (snack and full meal). For brevity, you can specify a single concrete airline and a single meal item for each category for that airline but should clearly indicate where additional concrete classes sit in the class hierarchy. Use the `Answers.md` file to add any additional explanation you may need.

Refer to "ANSWERS-TASK1-QUEST07.md"

QUEST08. Explain briefly how the design patterns facilitate extensibility based on points (1) and (2) above (one or two paragraphs each). Pay particular attention to how changes are isolated from client code.
